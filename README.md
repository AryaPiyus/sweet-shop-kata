## My AI Usage

- **Tools used:** ChatGPT.
- **How I used them:** I asked ChatGPT to outline the minimal steps for this task and to draft the README content, including the required AI usage section.
- **Reflection on impact:** Using ChatGPT sped up documentation writing and ensured the required disclosure was clear, while I still reviewed the text for accuracy and kept changes minimal.
